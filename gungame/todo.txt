shouldnt require receive to send        (separate receive and send threads)
make send only take 1 argument          (send takes 1 string that will then get split into all the used data)
make a lobby menu                       (do the important netcode stuff first)
multiple client support                 (example https://gist.github.com/sontx/4fc63c676bf9b03789865b58928a113d)
    Detect what client left

Send inputs instead of position         (might be a problem since send isnt as often as framerate, leads to being wrong position)
delta compression                       (only send the difference since last send)
Make the actual game
